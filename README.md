# CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
C++ Menu-Based CPU Scheduling Simulator for CSE316 (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR, Priority)

Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator (C++)

 CSE316 – Operating Systems | Lovely Professional University
 
 This project is an implementation of major CPU scheduling algorithms in a menu-driven C++ simulator,developed as part of CA2 for CSE316.

 Features:- 
 FCFS- SJF (Non-Preemptive)
 - SRTF (Preemptive SJF)
 - Round Robin (RR)
 - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
 - Gantt chart output
 - Waiting time, turnaround time calculation
 - CPU utilization
